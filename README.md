# DataViz Project
### by Charles Gallay, Thomas Batschelet and Valentine Santarelli

For our visualization project, we decided to focus our attention on environmental changes and plausible correlations between several aspects at a country level . 

Our goal will be to show the links between ecological footprints, GDP, CO2 emissions and global temperature changes in an interactive map that catches interest. The resulting tool will be an intuitive visualization that raises awareness among people and present actual knowledge by giving an objective insight about environmental changes without arguing global warming.

This thematic has certainly been a major topic for the last decade but we could argue that due to the massive amount of information that is regularly given by news, it can be hard to filter out the actual relevant facts that influence climate evolution. Therefore, it would be nice and helpful to be able to visualize different aspects of the changes to take a better grasp at the actual problems.

Technicalities:
A map of the world showing the average temperature per location through time. Build into this map, we want to integrate the possibility for the user to select one (or multiple country) to see more detail about a region, like the ecological footprint or GDP evolution.
Questions to our project can answer:
Is a healthy country more likely to impact the changes ? (GDP)
Does the ecological footprint of a country directly impacts its climate changes ?
Can we visualize the correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature changes at country level ? 
Does climate tend towards global warming or extreme temperatures (freezing winter and unusually warm summers)?
